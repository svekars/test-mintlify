## API Keys

The API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.example.com/settings/api-keys).

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

<Warning>
  **Keep your API keys secure!** Never expose API keys in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Bearer Authentication

Authentication to the API is performed via [Bearer Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/). Provide your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## Example Request

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://api.example.com/v1/users/usr_123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.example.com/v1/users/usr_123',
    headers=headers
)

print(response.json())
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/users/usr_123', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```ruby Ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'

uri = URI('https://api.example.com/v1/users/usr_123')
request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
request['Authorization'] = 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'

response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.hostname, uri.port, use_ssl: true) do |http|
  http.request(request)
end

puts response.body
```

## API Key Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Publishable Keys" icon="eye">
    Publishable keys are meant for client-side code. They can only perform read operations and limited actions.

    - Format: `pk_live_...` or `pk_test_...`
    - Safe to expose in client-side code
    - Limited permissions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Secret Keys" icon="lock">
    Secret keys should be kept confidential and only stored on your own servers.

    - Format: `sk_live_...` or `sk_test_...`
    - Must never be exposed publicly
    - Full API access
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Restricted Keys" icon="shield-halved">
    Create restricted keys with specific permissions for additional security.

    - Format: `rk_live_...` or `rk_test_...`
    - Customizable permissions
    - Recommended for production
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Test vs Live Mode

The API has two modes: test mode and live mode. Each mode has its own set of API keys.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Test Mode">
    Use test mode to try out API calls and integration without affecting your live data.

    - API keys begin with `pk_test_` or `sk_test_`
    - No real transactions processed
    - Separate data from live mode
    - Free to use for testing

    ```bash
    # Test mode example
    curl https://api.example.com/v1/users \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_abc123..."
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Live Mode">
    Live mode uses real API keys and processes actual transactions.

    - API keys begin with `pk_live_` or `sk_live_`
    - Real transactions and data
    - Requires completed account setup
    - Subject to rate limits

    ```bash
    # Live mode example
    curl https://api.example.com/v1/users \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_xyz789..."
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managing API Keys

### Creating a New Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Go to your [Dashboard Settings](https://dashboard.example.com/settings/api-keys).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Create Key">
    Select the type of key you want to create (secret, publishable, or restricted).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Permissions">
    For restricted keys, select the specific permissions you want to grant.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Securely">
    Copy your new API key and store it securely. You won't be able to see it again!
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Rotating Keys

We recommend rotating your API keys regularly for security:

1. Create a new API key in the Dashboard
2. Update your application to use the new key
3. Test thoroughly in your staging environment
4. Deploy the changes to production
5. Delete the old key from the Dashboard

<Note>
  Keep both keys active during the transition period to avoid service interruptions.
</Note>

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Environment Variables">
    Store API keys in environment variables, not in your code:

    ```bash
    # .env file
    API_KEY=sk_live_your_key_here
    ```

    ```python
    import os
    api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Restricted Keys">
    Create restricted keys with only the permissions your application needs:

    - Principle of least privilege
    - Limits damage if key is compromised
    - Easy to audit access
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Separate Keys per Environment">
    Use different API keys for each environment:

    - Development: `sk_test_dev_...`
    - Staging: `sk_test_staging_...`
    - Production: `sk_live_prod_...`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Key Usage">
    Regularly review API key usage in your Dashboard:

    - Check for unusual activity
    - Audit which keys are being used
    - Delete unused keys
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` error:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "authentication_error",
    "message": "Invalid API key provided",
    "code": "invalid_api_key"
  }
}
```

Common authentication errors:

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `invalid_api_key` | The API key provided is invalid |
| `missing_api_key` | No API key was provided |
| `expired_api_key` | The API key has expired |
| `insufficient_permissions` | The API key doesn't have required permissions |
